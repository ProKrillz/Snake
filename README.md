# Snake

## Description

Snake is a game where you are a snake that eats apples.
When the snake eats apples, it gets longer and faster. This is my first program in wpf and I have encountered many problems. Binding I tried to work with, but couldn't get it to work with the backend the way i want. It was fun to make your own features.

Program build from this <a href="https://www.wpf-tutorial.com/creating-game-snakewpf/introduction/" target="_blank">Link</a> and build some own features
